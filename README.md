The main purpose of this study is to design a regenerative motor-driven 6-axis robot and perform optimal trajectory planning. 
To this end, three main objectives have been identified: mechanical design process, motor driver design, and controller design. 
In the mechanical design process, the structural and mechanical design of the robot will be thoroughly addressed to comply with industrial standards. 
During the motor driver design stage, appropriate motor driver topology selection will be made, power electronics design will be carried out, and control circuits will be created. 
In controller design, sensor integration, trajectory planning algorithms, and real-time control algorithms will be developed to ensure precise and reliable control of the robot. 
Regenerative motor drivers enhance energy efficiency, while optimal trajectory planning can increase process efficiency and optimize operations. 
In this context, the study aims to contribute to the development of innovative technologies in industrial robotics applications, thereby enhancing productivity and competitiveness in the manufacturing industry. 
Additionally, this study aims to provide a new perspective in the literature on the design and control of robotic systems, aiming to make a novel contribution to the research field.
